A horrible mix of C♯ and Java that I wrote in the early summer of 2013. I intend to improve this over time.

I've felt a recent urge to revive this project, which is a keystroke capturer plus socket client on the C♯ end and a socket server plus mini-terminal on the Java end. I really dislike writing code in C♯, hence the blatant disregard for anything that a C♯ programmer would consider "permissible" in my code.

The Java code uses beautiful reflection, and I think I intend to streamline it. This is a fun project to write and to use on the Java side, so I want to write and use it more often.
